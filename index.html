        <span style="font-weight: bolder">Alan Turing</span> was an English
        mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher,
        and theoretical biologist. Turing was highly influential in the
        development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation
        of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine,
        which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer. Turing is
        widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and
        artificial intelligence.
        <br />
        <br />
        Born in Maida Vale, London, Turing was raised in southern England. He
        graduated at King's College, Cambridge, with a degree in mathematics.
        Whilst he was a fellow at Cambridge, he published a proof demonstrating
        that some purely mathematical yes–no questions can never be answered by
        computation and defined a Turing machine, and went on to prove the
        halting problem for Turing machines is undecidable. In 1938, he obtained
        his PhD from the Department of Mathematics at Princeton University.
        During the Second World War, Turing worked for the Government Code and
        Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking centre
        that produced Ultra intelligence. For a time he led Hut 8, the section
        that was responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. Here, he devised a
        number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers,
        including improvements to the pre-war Polish bombe method, an
        electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma
        machine. Turing played a crucial role in cracking intercepted coded
        messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Axis powers in many
        crucial engagements, including the Battle of the Atlantic.
        <br />
        <br />
        After the war, Turing worked at the National Physical Laboratory, where
        he designed the Automatic Computing Engine (ACE), one of the first
        designs for a stored-program computer. In 1948, Turing joined Max
        Newman's Computing Machine Laboratory, at the Victoria University of
        Manchester, where he helped develop the Manchester computers and became
        interested in mathematical biology. He wrote a paper on the chemical
        basis of morphogenesis and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such
        as the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction, first observed in the 1960s.
        Despite these accomplishments, he was never fully recognised in his home
        country during his lifetime because much of his work was covered by the
        Official Secrets Act.
        <br />
        <br />
        Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts. He accepted chemical
        castration treatment, with DES, as an alternative to prison. Turing died
        in 1954, 16 days before his 42nd birthday, from cyanide poisoning. An
        inquest determined his death as a suicide, but it has been noted that
        the known evidence is also consistent with accidental poisoning.
        <br />
        <br />
        In 2009, following an Internet campaign, British Prime Minister Gordon
        Brown made an official public apology on behalf of the British
        government for "the appalling way he was treated". Queen Elizabeth II
        granted Turing a posthumous pardon in 2013. The "Alan Turing law" is now
        an informal term for a 2017 law in the United Kingdom that retroactively
        pardoned men cautioned or convicted under historical legislation that
        outlawed homosexual acts. Turing has an extensive legacy with statues of
        him and many things named after him, including an annual award for
        computer science innovations. He appears on the current Bank of England
        £50 note, which was released to coincide with his birthday. A 2019 BBC
        series, as voted by the audience, named him the greatest person of the
        20th century.
